YouPy is a simple program coded in Python, with this program you'll be able to download
some YouTube video or just get information of the video (like the title, views, length, and more...)
the program is in 1.0 and not finished, updates will be coming. If you want some features, just
contact me by Discord or Twitter.

## Requirements
- Python3.x | Try to get the newest version, it's better
- pytube | 'pip install pytube'
- colorama | 'pip install colorama'

## How it works?
- Transfer all downloaded files in the same folder
- Open a CMD in the folder
